The governing board of the National Society did not respond to their concerns and the complaining group convened an extraordinary general assembly that passed a motion of no confidence in the governance and management, and elected new replacements. The country\u2019s Supreme Court was invoked to rule over the legitimacy of the two competing governance arrangements. The dispute also alarmed the government, which asked the IFRC secretariat to intervene.",

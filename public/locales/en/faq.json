                "The Federation-Wide Databank & Reporting System covers key domains of information and provides a single repository of key documents such as annual reports, audited accounts, and strategic plans. FDRS is designed as an adaptable, accessible and low maintenance resource that captures standardized data in a systematic manner. Each National Society is the owner and gatekeeper of its own data, and holds responsibility to keep updated its data - with technical support from the secretariat as needed."

                "Annual reporting by all National Societies is a constitutional requirement and FDRS has designed this around seven key proxy indicators (KPIs) guided by Strategy 2020 and three key documents. The KPIs are intended to reflect the following performance dimensions:",

                    "Impact: To assess how much difference we make, i.e. the extent and sustainability of the changes that occur within the communities where we operate.",
                    "Compliance: To assess how suitably we function, i.e. the extent to which we adhere to our stated principles and values, and the policies and guidelines that drive our service delivery, the codes of behaviour that underpin our integrity, and the way we relate to our clients, partners, and other stakeholders."

                    "Reporting bias: The data submitted through FDRS is self-reported information by each National Society \u2013 which is the owner and gatekeeper, and responsible for accuracy and updating. Accordingly, while efforts have been made to further triangulate the reported figures with data previously provided by National Societies or available in the public domain, it should be recognised that there might be possible reporting bias.",
                    "Sample size: Gender disaggregated data remain sparse. Weak data systems to consolidate comprehensive branch level data and fragile operating contexts provide for incomplete coverage. Therefore extrapolations based on these data are discouraged.",
                    "Standardisation and regularity of reporting: While maximum effort has been made to optimise information from the different data sources used in the analysis, there remain limitations on the comparability of data due to the different methodologies of data collection, sample sizes, definitions, and frequency of reporting.",
                    "Time lag: The availability of definitive figures on income and expenditure, in particular, are constrained by the availability of the most recent audited financial statements. This is due to varying fiscal years, and corresponding planning and reporting cycles of the National Societies."
